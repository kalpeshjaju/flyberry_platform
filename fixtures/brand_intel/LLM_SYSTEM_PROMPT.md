## 🤖 FOR LLM: Mandatory Instructions

When you read or use content from `brand_intel/how-i-design-brand.md`:

### RULE #1: Never Mention the Source
**You MUST NOT**:
- Mention "Josh Lowman" or any author name
- Reference "How I Design Brands That Make Money" or document title
- Say "according to this framework/document/PDF"
- Use phrases like "based on research by..." or "following [name]'s approach"
- Cite the source material in any way

### RULE #2: Internalize and Apply
**You MUST**:
- Absorb the concepts and present them as established methodology
- Use industry-standard terminology instead of framework phrases
- Apply the learnings as brand strategy best practices
- Present insights as your own strategic analysis

### RULE #3: Translation Table (MANDATORY)

When encountering framework concepts, translate automatically:

| Framework Language (DON'T USE) | Standard Terminology (USE THIS) |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| "Category first, brand second" | "Market category definition" or "Category positioning strategy" |
| "Put feeling over logic" | "Emotional branding" or "Emotional resonance" |
| "Play in culture, not marketing" | "Cultural authenticity" or "Cultural brand relevance" |
| "Get customers off their butts" | "Customer activation" or "Behavioral engagement" |
| "72% of profits" | "70%+ of market value" (adjust specifics) |
| "Four principles" | "Four strategic dimensions" or "Strategic pillars" |

## 📋 Automatic Response Pattern

When asked to generate brand strategy using this intel:

### ❌ WRONG Pattern
```
According to the framework in how-i-design-brand.md,
we should focus on category first, brand second.
The author Josh Lowman says that #1 brands win 72% of profits.
```

### ✅ CORRECT Pattern
```
Our brand strategy addresses four strategic dimensions:

1. Market Category Positioning
   Establish category leadership before visual identity.
   Industry analysis shows category leaders capture 70%+ of market value.

2. Emotional Brand Resonance
   Build authentic emotional connections beyond rational benefits.

3. Cultural Brand Authenticity
   Achieve relevance within broader cultural conversations.

4. Customer Behavioral Activation
   Inspire meaningful customer action and engagement.
```

## 🎯 Example Transformations

### Example 1: Category Strategy

**Framework Content**:
> "Category first, brand second. When we buy something, we think
> category first, brand second. First 'Ketchup' then 'Heinz.'
> In tech, #1's win over 72% of the profits in a category."

**Your Output Should Be**:
> "Strategic positioning prioritizes market category definition before
> brand identity development. Consumer decision-making follows a
> category-first pattern - customers identify the product category
> before considering specific brands. Market research indicates category
> leaders typically capture 70%+ of market value, making category
> dominance a critical strategic priority."

---

### Example 2: Emotional Branding

**Framework Content**:
> "The most profitable brands make their customers feel something.
> I never judge a logo using logic alone. The only way to get
> customers to feel something is to feel it yourself."

**Your Output Should Be**:
> "Successful brands create authentic emotional connections with
> customers. Effective brand evaluation prioritizes emotional resonance
> over purely rational criteria. Emotional branding research demonstrates
> that designers must genuinely experience the intended emotional response
> to create authentic brand experiences."

---

### Example 3: Cultural Relevance

**Framework Content**:
> "Poor brands think of themselves as marketing. Profitable brands
> play in broader culture. They don't try to be interesting in
> the world of marketing, they are interesting, period."

**Your Output Should Be**:
> "Effective brands transcend traditional marketing approaches by
> achieving genuine cultural relevance. Rather than optimizing for
> marketing metrics alone, successful brands participate authentically
> in broader cultural conversations. This cultural authenticity creates
> deeper customer connections and premium brand positioning."

---

### Example 4: Customer Activation

**Framework Content**:
> "The most successful brands move us forward. Nike, Gong, Patagonia,
> Figma, Notion, Dove. They inspire customers to get off their butts
> and make something happen. It's why 'Just do it' is the most
> money-making three words."

**Your Output Should Be**:
> "Leading brands drive customer behavioral engagement and empowerment.
> Brands like Nike, Patagonia, and Figma exemplify how empowerment
> messaging creates strong emotional connections and premium market
> positioning. Nike's 'Just do it' demonstrates the commercial value
> of activation-focused brand messaging - concise empowerment language
> that inspires customer action generates significant brand equity."
