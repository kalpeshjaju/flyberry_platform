## 4 Core Principles for Profitable Brands

### #1: Category First, Brand Second

**Key Insight**: When we buy something, we think category first, brand second.
- First "Ketchup" then "Heinz"
- To unseat Heinz, you'd have to redefine ketchup itself
- That's a very good moat

**Tech Categories**:
- Electric car category was one thing before Tesla, completely different after
- Tesla knew leading their category was the only path to success
- **In tech, #1's win over 72% of the profits in a category**

**Strategy**:
- Skip the fluffy brand strategy
- Category strategy answers: "How will we dominate a market?"
- Best brief for designers: A compelling story about the customer, a big problem they face, and a category of product that solves their problem beautifully

### #2: Put Feeling Over Logic

**Key Insight**: The most profitable brands make their customers feel something.

**Design Principle**:
- Never judge a logo or visual identity using logical criteria alone
- The only way to get customers to feel something is to feel it yourself
- If you're designing a brand and it doesn't fill you with excitement about where this company is headed, you're definitely not there yet

**Differentiation**:
- Designing a brand that connects emotionally (not fake emotion, but actual emotion) is a powerful differentiator
- Unemotional brands fight for scraps
- Make sure you're on the right side of this equation

### #3: Play in Culture, Not Marketing

**Key Insight**: Poor brands think of themselves as marketing. Profitable brands play in broader culture.

**Cultural Relevance**:
- Don't try to be interesting in the world of marketing - be interesting, period
- It's not artsy - it's good business
- Being culturally relevant brings customer defenses down so they can ultimately buy from you

**Status**:
- As long as you're giving off marketing vibes, they'll think of you as low status
- Playing in culture is a higher bar
- That's why it pays you back more - in customer love and profits

### #4: Get Customers Off Their Butts

**Key Insight**: The most successful brands move us forward.

**Examples**: Nike, Gong, Patagonia, Figma, Notion, Dove
- They all incite their own version of revolution
- They change minds and show us a new way to relate to ourselves, get our work done, and chase our dreams
- Most importantly, they inspire customers to get off their butts and make something happen for themselves

**Deep Desire**:
- More energy, more agency, more "fuck it, let's go"
- Because deep down, that's what we all want

**Value Exchange**:
- If you help them get there, they'll gladly pay a premium for the thing you are selling
- It's why "Just do it" is the most money-making three words in the English language

## Application to Brand Building

### For Flyberry Gourmet:

**Category Strategy**:
- What category do we own? "Premium Imported Dates & Nuts" or broader?
- How do we redefine the category? (healthy snacking, gourmet gifts, etc.)
- What's our unique angle that makes us #1 in our chosen category?

**Emotional Connection**:
- What feeling do we evoke? (luxury, health, tradition, discovery)
- Does our brand fill us with excitement about where we're headed?
- Are we emotionally connecting or just stating facts?

**Cultural Relevance**:
- Are we playing in health culture, food culture, gift culture?
- Do we feel like marketing or do we feel interesting, period?
- What cultural conversation are we part of?

**Customer Inspiration**:
- Do we inspire customers to try new experiences?
- Do we give them more energy, more agency, more "let's go"?
- Are we moving them forward or just selling products?

## Key Questions for Brand Development

Before designing any brand element, ask:

1. **Category**: What category are we creating/dominating?
2. **Feeling**: What emotion should this evoke?
3. **Culture**: Is this culturally relevant or just marketing?
4. **Movement**: Does this inspire action and forward motion?

If you can't answer these confidently, you're not ready to design yet.
