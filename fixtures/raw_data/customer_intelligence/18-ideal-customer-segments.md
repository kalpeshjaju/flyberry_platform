## JOBS-TO-BE-DONE FRAMEWORK

---

### **PRIMARY JOB #1: "IMPRESS WITHOUT RISK"**

**Situation**: Hosting dinner party / giving gift / serving guests

**Customer Thought**:
> "I want to impress people with world-class gourmet, but I can't risk serving something mediocre or fake."

**Functional Job**: Serve/gift premium gourmet that will be universally appreciated

**Emotional Job**: Feel confident, sophisticated, generous

**Social Job**: Be seen as discerning, worldly, quality-conscious

**Why They Hire Flyberry**:
> "Fortune 500 companies trust this brand for CEO gifts. If I serve Flyberry, I can't go wrong."

**Competing Solutions**:
- Mass brands (Happilo) - risky, might not impress
- Import luxury (Bateel) - expensive, hard to find
- Homemade - time-consuming, inconsistent
- Nothing - safer but boring

**Flyberry's Advantage**:
Fortune 500 validation removes all risk. Ultra-premium quality at accessible price.

**Success Metric**: Guests ask "Where did you get these dates?" / Gift recipient messages "This is incredible, thank you!"

**Segments**: Corporate Gifters (primary), Affluent Parents, Luxury Conscious

---

### **PRIMARY JOB #2: "MAINTAIN HEALTHY INDULGENCE"**

**Situation**: Want snack / craving something / bored eating

**Customer Thought**:
> "I want something that tastes indulgent but is actually healthy. Not cardboard 'health food', not guilty junk."

**Functional Job**: Satisfy craving with nutritious, delicious food

**Emotional Job**: Feel good about choices (health + pleasure)

**Social Job**: Demonstrate self-care, quality-consciousness

**Why They Hire Flyberry**:
> "These dates/nuts are naturally sweet, rich flavor, and actually good for me. No guilt."

**Competing Solutions**:
- Chocolate/sweets - guilt, unhealthy
- Mass-market dry fruits - boring, inconsistent quality

### **PRIMARY JOB #3: "SIGNAL STATUS WITHOUT SHOWING OFF"**

**Situation**: Want to demonstrate taste/sophistication subtly

> "I want people to notice I have refined taste, but I don't want to be flashy or show-offy about it."

**Functional Job**: Purchase products that signal quality discernment

**Emotional Job**: Feel sophisticated, confident in taste

**Social Job**: Be recognized as someone with refined taste

**Why They Hire Flyberry**:
> "The packaging says 'Fortune 500 Trusted' and origin stories show I know about Medina Ajwa dates. Subtle flex."

**Competing Solutions**:
- Luxury imports (Bateel) - too obvious, tryhard
- Mass brands (Happilo) - no status signal
- Artisan local - nice but limited appeal
- International shopping - not accessible

**Flyberry's Advantage**:
Sophisticated enough to impress the discerning. Accessible enough to not seem show-off-y.

**Social Job**: Demonstrate company's quality standards and appreciation

**Why They Hire Flyberry**:
> "50+ Fortune 500 companies already use this. Proven solution for corporate gifting."

Corporate-proven, scalable, consistent quality. Can handle 500-person order with same quality as 1 hamper.
