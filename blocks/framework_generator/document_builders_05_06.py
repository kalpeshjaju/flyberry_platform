FILE PURPOSE: Spec-driven section builders for Documents 05 (Fortune 500 Validation) and 06 (Brand Promise)

⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️  CRITICAL: NO HALLUCINATIONS ALLOWED  ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️

THIS GENERATOR MUST ONLY READ DATA FROM JSON FILES.

FORBIDDEN (Will break build & block commits):
❌ Hard-coded dictionaries (client_stories = [...], case_studies = [...], etc.)
❌ Fabricated corporate details (volumes, employees, audit results)
❌ Invented case studies or testimonials
❌ Made-up competitive comparisons
❌ Any content not in corporate-clients.json

ALLOWED:
✅ Reading from corporate-clients.json (client name, sector, use case, testimonial)
✅ Reading from certifications.json
✅ Simple formatting/structuring of JSON data
✅ Markdown templates (structural, not data)

CORPORATE DATA RULES (STRICTLY ENFORCED):
- Use ONLY: Client name, sector, since year, use case, testimonial (from JSON)
- DO NOT invent: Specific volumes (500kg/month), employee counts, audit details,
  case study narratives, challenge-solution stories

IF YOU NEED MORE DATA:
1. Get client approval for specific details FIRST
2. Add to corporate-clients.json with verified data
3. THEN read from JSON in this generator
4. NEVER hard-code corporate data in Python

ENFORCEMENT:
- Pre-commit hook specifically checks for fabricated corporate phrases
- Tests will fail if invented corporate details detected
- Validator script scans for forbidden patterns

⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️  VIOLATION = BUILD FAILURE  ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️

CONTEXT: Part of the progressive refactoring from hardcoded generators to spec-driven builders.
         These builders read document specs and generate content dynamically from structured data.

DEPENDENCIES:
- Document specs: doc-05-fortune-500-validation.md, doc-06-brand-promise.md
- Data files: corporate-clients.json, certifications.json
