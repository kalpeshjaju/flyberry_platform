### Integration with Build Pipeline

**build.py workflow** (3-step validation):

```python
def build_all():
    # STEP 1: Validate reference data quality
    validator = ReferenceDataValidator(data_dir)
    validation_report = validator.validate_all_reference_files()

    if not validation_report["production_ready"]:
        print("⚠️  WARNING: Reference data not at production quality")
        print(f"   {validation_report['by_confidence']['high']}/{validation_report['total_files']} HIGH confidence")

    # STEP 2: Check data completeness
    missing_data = data_source.check_data_completeness()
    if missing_data:
        print("⚠️  WARNING: Missing data detected")

    # STEP 3: Initialize hallucination guard
    hallucination_guard = HallucinationGuard(data_source.data, data_dir)

    # ... proceed with content generation
```

## Validation Framework Details

### ReferenceDataValidator Class

**Location**: `validators/reference_data_validator.py`
**Size**: 400 lines
**Purpose**: Automated quality checks for all reference data files

**Validation Checks**:

1. **Metadata Verification**
   - Required fields: source, date, extractedBy, confidence, needsVerification
   - All fields present and non-empty
   - Date format validation (YYYY-MM-DD)

2. **Source Quality Scoring**
   ```python
   HIGH (0.85):    Official sources, <3 months old, URLs provided, 2+ sources
   MEDIUM (0.65):  Reputable sources, <6 months old, URL provided
   LOW (0.30):     Template/estimated, requires verification
   ```

3. **Freshness Scoring**
   ```python
   CURRENT:   <90 days (3 months)
   RECENT:    90-180 days (3-6 months)
   OUTDATED:  >365 days (1 year)
   ```

4. **Completeness Detection**
   - Scans for placeholders: `[To be collected]`, `[TBD]`, `PLACEHOLDER`, `XXX`
   - Counts placeholder instances
   - Flags files with >5 placeholders as incomplete

5. **Production Readiness**
   - Calculates % of HIGH confidence files
   - Requires >50% HIGH for production warning
   - Requires >70% HIGH for production ready

**Output**: Generates `REFERENCE_DATA_VALIDATION_REPORT.md` with:
- File-by-file confidence scores
- Freshness assessment
- Placeholder counts
- Production readiness verdict
- Recommendations for improvement

### HallucinationGuard Class

**Location**: `validators/hallucination_guard.py`
**Size**: 450 lines
**Purpose**: Runtime anti-hallucination enforcement during content generation

#### Checkpoint 1: BEFORE Generation

**What it does**:
```python
def checkpoint1_verify_data(self, act_name: str, required_data: List[str]) -> Dict:
    """
    Verify data availability before generating content.

    Returns:
    {
        "data_availability": {"products": "100% complete", ...},
        "source_quality": {"products": "HIGH confidence", ...},
        "missing_data": [...],
        "confidence_score": 0.85,
        "can_proceed": True/False
    }
    """
```

**Example Output**:
```
✅ products: 13 items (100% complete)

    ✅ GOOD: "67% prefer dry fruits (Source: market-trends-reference.json:consumerData)"
    ❌ BAD: "Most customers prefer healthy snacks" [No source]
    """
```

**Citation Format**:
```
[CLAIM] (Source: [file]:[path.to.data])
```

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Global dates market valued at $31.03B in 2024 (Source: market-size-reference.json:globalMarket.datesMarket.marketSize2024)"
- ✅ "67% of consumers pick makhanas/dry fruits as go-to snacks (Source: market-trends-reference.json:consumerData.makhanaAndDryFruits.consumerPreference)"
- ❌ "Studies show dates are popular in India" [UNSOURCED - REJECT]

---

#### Checkpoint 3: AFTER Generation

**What it does**:
```python
def checkpoint3_audit_output(self, generated_content: str, act_name: str) -> Dict:
    """
    Scans generated HTML for hallucination indicators.

    Checks:
    - Unsourced claims: "Studies show", "Research indicates", "Experts say"
    - Placeholder text: "[TBD]", "PLACEHOLDER", "XXX"
    - Citation density: <1 citation per 200 words = LOW
    - Vague references: "according to sources", "recent studies"

    Returns:
    {
        "unsourced_claims": [...],
        "placeholder_count": 0,

    # Scan for TODO/FIXME/placeholder in generator code
    if grep -E "TODO|FIXME|placeholder|XXX" generators/*.py; then
      echo "❌ Found placeholder in generators"
    fi
```

**Checks**:
- ✅ 15-test comprehensive suite (93% pass rate target)
- ✅ Scans generator code for placeholder patterns
- ✅ Uploads test reports as artifacts (30-day retention)

---

#### Job 3: Enforce Confidence & Freshness

```bash
# Count HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW files using jq
for file in *-reference.json; do
  CONFIDENCE=$(jq -r '.metadata.confidence' "$file")
  # Calculate % HIGH confidence
done

# Check freshness (stale if >180 days old)
DAYS_OLD=$(( (CURRENT_DATE - FILE_DATE) / 86400 ))
if [ $DAYS_OLD -gt 180 ]; then
  echo "🔴 STALE - >6 months old"
fi
```

**Checks**:
- ✅ Calculates HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW distribution
- ⚠️ Warns if <50% HIGH confidence
- 🔴 Flags files >180 days old as STALE

## Technical Debt & Future Improvements

### Technical Debt (Accepted)

1. **Test Import Issue** (`generate_research_tasks`)
   - Status: Non-blocking, 93% pass rate acceptable
   - Impact: Low - function exists and works
   - Fix: Refactor test expectation (not critical)

2. **Manual Testimonial Collection**
   - Status: Requires human effort, can't automate
   - Impact: Medium - delays 100% HIGH confidence
   - Fix: Progressive rollout (Phase 1-3)

3. **Certification Documentation**
   - Status: Requires document hunting
   - Impact: Low - nice-to-have, not critical
   - Fix: 1-2 weeks effort when ready for public launch
